# Message Blocker by MC-resource
## https://github.com/MC-Resources-Store/message-blocker

### Please add the plain text as 'message' - color codes are ignored!
### Valid options for 'mode': 'contains', 'exact', 'starts_with', 'ends_with'
### If 'ignore_case' is set to true, the capitalization of the message doesn't matter.
### 'bypass'permission' is optional. Players who have the specified permission are exempted and will always receive the message.
### Please note that this doesn't only affect server, but also player messages.
